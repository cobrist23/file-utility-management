# Week 14 Report â€“ File Utility Management Project

## 1. What hurdles have you faced so far?

Working on this project, the biggest hurdle was figuring out how to start. I had a clear goal in 
mind that being, organizing files by extension, but turning that idea into a working shell script took some trial 
and error. I also ran into challenges with recursive folder handling, avoiding file overwrite conflicts, 
and making sure the script was easy to use. Learning how to make the script flexible and reliable required
a lot of troubleshooting.

## 2. How did you solve them?

I broke the problem into smaller parts and tackled each feature one at a time. I used the `find` 
command to recursively scan files, added checks to prevent overwriting existing files, and built a 
dry-run mode for safety. I also added logging so I could verify that the script was doing what I 
expected. Whenever I got stuck, I researched Unix commands and tested different approaches until I 
found one that worked. By debugging and improving the script step by step, I eventually got it to meet 
all the goals I outlined in the original project plan.

## 3. What are your next steps?

The main functionality of the script is complete, so my next steps were to:
- Finalize and test the script one more time
- Write this report
- Upload both the script and the report to GitHub

I focused on making sure the documentation and script are clean, easy to follow, and fully functional.
